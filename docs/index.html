<i>Media Disclosures does not rate any content, as traditional ratings boards, like the ESRB or MPAA do. Instead, it is a self-rating system for use by creators who do not have the resources to go to a formal board for a formal rating. Because of this, Media Disclosures makes no statement on the accuracy of the ratings, and any questions about the rating of a specific piece of content should be directed to the content creators.</i>
